                           "A cybernetic organism or “cyborg” in IT is defined as an organism with both biological and technological components. In some definitions, a cyborg is described as a hypothetical or fictional creation. However, in a technical sense, humans can be seen as cyborgs in various types of situations, including the use of artificial implants.<br>
                           &emsp; &emsp;A person could be considered a cyborg when they are outfitted with implants such as artificial heart valves, cochlear implants or insulin pumps. A person could even be called a cyborg when they are using specific wearable technologies like Google Glass, or even using laptops or mobile devices to do work."
